# Analytics Platform — How It Helps the Organisation

> **Presentation focus**: Walk through the system from **Inbox** down the navigation, emphasising how each area helps the organisation (operations, decisions, compliance, and growth).

---

## 1. Title / Intro

**One platform for operations and insight**

- Cross-channel: web + WhatsApp + agent-assisted
- Single place: handle conversations, see performance, and improve journeys
- Built for scale: teams, roles, and tenant-specific labels

---

## 2. Inbox

**What it is**  
The agent inbox is where support staff see and handle live conversations (e.g. WhatsApp). Agents can filter by All, Assigned, Active, Resolved, Expired; accept chats; send messages (text, media, location); view a taxpayer/contact profile; transfer to another agent or team; and resolve with optional wrap-up (category, notes, outcome).

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Faster response**: One inbox for all conversations, so nothing is lost in email or other tools.
- **Clear ownership**: Assign → Accept → Resolve keeps every conversation owned and trackable.
- **Consistency**: Transfer with optional reason and wrap-up on resolve improves handoffs and auditability.
- **Re-engagement**: For expired (inactive) chats, agents can send a re-engagement message instead of leaving them unresolved.
- **Context**: Contact profile in the same screen helps agents give accurate, personalised support (e.g. for tax filings).

**Talking point**: “Inbox is where we turn conversations into resolved cases and happy taxpayers.”

---

## 3. Contacts

**What it is**  
A list of contacts derived from WhatsApp (and related) activity: contact ID, name, first/last seen, message count. Supports view profile, export CSV, import CSV (Name + Phone), and optional deactivate.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Single view of who we talk to**: All messaging contacts in one place, with engagement (message count, last seen).
- **Bulk operations**: Import lists (e.g. campaigns, segments) and export for reporting or CRM.
- **Data hygiene**: Deactivate contacts when needed (e.g. opt-out, wrong number) so lists stay accurate.
- **Audit and reporting**: “Who did we engage with, when, and how much?” without digging through chat logs.

**Talking point**: “Contacts turns messaging data into a manageable, exportable list we can use for service and campaigns.”

---

## 4. Team Management

**What it is**  
Create and manage teams; assign agents to teams; assign queues (inbox work) to teams; see queue stats (size, active chats, wait time, resolution time); bulk transfer chats to a team; and mass re-engagement for expired conversations.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Structure**: Organise support by department, product, or geography (e.g. “Tax Filing Team”, “WhatsApp Support”).
- **Fair load**: Queue assignment and stats (queue size, wait time) help balance work across teams and avoid overload.
- **Speed**: Bulk transfer and mass re-engagement let supervisors fix backlogs and re-open stale conversations quickly.
- **Performance visibility**: Queue and resolution metrics feed into Agent Analytics and Wrap-up Reports, so the organisation can see which teams are effective.

**Talking point**: “Team Management is how we organise who does what and keep queues under control.”

---

## 5. Knowledge Base

**What it is**
Central repository for standard operating procedures (SOPs), scripts, and help articles. Agents can search/view during chats; Admins can create/edit content.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Consistency**: Ensure every agent gives the same correct answer to taxpayers.
- **Speed**: Faster resolution by cutting down research time during live chats.
- **Training**: New agents get up to speed faster with built-in reference material and scripts.

**Talking point**: "The Knowledge Base puts the right answer at every agent's fingertips."

---

## 6. Overview (Analytics)

**What it is**
Executive dashboard: total sessions, unique users, completion rate, average session duration, identified-user share; trends (sessions, conversion, user growth); daily active users; traffic by device, browser, journey (page path), country; activity heatmap (day × hour).

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Health at a glance**: Leadership sees volume, conversion, and engagement without opening raw data.
- **Trends**: Spot growth or drop-off (e.g. post-campaign, tax deadline) and plan capacity.
- **Where users are**: Device, browser, country, and journey breakdown inform channel and UX decisions.
- **When they’re active**: Heatmap supports staffing and campaign timing (e.g. WhatsApp hours).

**Talking point**: “Overview answers: How many people, how well are they converting, and where and when are they active?”

---

## 7. Funnels

**What it is**
Configurable multi-step funnels (e.g. Page View → Validation → OTP → Return Filed). Shows count and percentage at each step and drop-off between steps; supports journey-based flags (e.g. journey start/end) and date range.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Find friction**: See exactly where users drop (e.g. after OTP, before payment) so product and support can fix bottlenecks.
- **Measure journey success**: Compare MRI vs TOT vs NIL (or any journey) and track improvement over time.
- **Evidence for change**: Funnel data backs business cases for UX, copy, or process changes.

**Talking point**: “Funnels show where we lose people so we can fix the right step.”

---

## 8. User Journeys

**What it is**
Per-user cross-channel timeline: web and WhatsApp events in one sequence with properties.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Full picture**: Understand “this user did X on web, then Y on WhatsApp” for support and complaints.
- **Root cause**: When something goes wrong, journey view shows what actually happened instead of relying on memory.
- **Cross-channel strategy**: See how web and messaging interact so the organisation can design better handoffs and messaging.

**Talking point**: “User Journeys turn separate channels into one story per taxpayer.”

---

## 9. Self-Serve vs Assisted

**What it is**
Analytics comparing self-serve (e.g. web-only) vs assisted (e.g. agent or bot involvement) completion and volume.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Channel mix**: Decide how much to invest in self-serve vs human support based on completion and cost.
- **Automation impact**: See if bot/self-serve adoption reduces assisted volume without hurting outcomes.
- **Capacity planning**: Balance agent capacity with self-serve funnel performance.

**Talking point**: “Self-Serve vs Assisted shows whether we’re scaling through automation or through people.”

---

## 10. WhatsApp (Analytics)

**What it is**
WhatsApp-specific metrics: message volume (in/out), read rates, new contacts, response time (e.g. histogram, median), volume by hour, activity heatmap, message funnel (sent → delivered → read → replied), traffic by country, agent performance (e.g. chats resolved).

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Channel performance**: Know how WhatsApp is used (volume, peaks, geography) for resourcing and campaigns.
- **Quality of service**: Response time and read rates show if we’re answering fast enough and if messages are seen.
- **Agent effectiveness**: Resolutions per agent (and team) inform training and staffing.
- **Funnel**: Sent → delivered → read → replied highlights delivery or engagement issues.

**Talking point**: “WhatsApp analytics tell us how well we’re performing on the channel taxpayers use most.”

---

## 11. Campaigns

**What it is**
Campaign management and optimisation: list campaigns, view reports, clone campaigns; optimise targeting and timing using analytics.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Outbound at scale**: Run and repeat campaigns (reminders, nudges, info) without ad-hoc sends.
- **Learning**: Campaign reports plus Overview/Funnels show what drove replies or conversions.
- **Efficiency**: Clone and tweak successful campaigns instead of rebuilding from scratch.

**Talking point**: “Campaigns turn our contact list and analytics into repeatable, measurable outreach.”

---

## 12. Agent Analytics

**What it is**
Aggregate agent (and team) performance: chats handled, resolution time, response time, volume over time, comparison across agents/teams.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Fair evaluation**: Objective metrics (resolutions, time) support feedback and recognition.
- **Training needs**: Spot agents or teams that need support or process changes.
- **SLA monitoring**: Track resolution and response times against targets.
- **Resource planning**: Volume and resolution time feed into headcount and shift planning.

**Talking point**: “Agent Analytics turns inbox activity into clear performance and capacity signals.”

---

## 13. Agent Logs

**What it is**
Log of agent activity: availability (on/off), session history, assigned/accepted/resolved sessions.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Operational visibility**: Supervisors see who was on, who took which chats, and when.
- **Dispute and audit**: “Who handled this case?” and “Was this agent available?” are answerable from logs.
- **Patterns**: Spot overwork, underutilisation, or scheduling mismatches (e.g. peak hours vs coverage).

**Talking point**: “Agent Logs give a clear record of who did what and when for operations and compliance.”

---

## 14. AI & Intents

**What it is**
AI/LLM metrics: classifications, accuracy, latency, errors; top intents; latency distribution; error breakdown.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Bot quality**: See if the AI is classifying intents correctly and responding fast enough.
- **Where AI fails**: Error and intent breakdown show where to improve training or hand off to humans.
- **Cost and UX**: Latency and error rates affect user satisfaction and cost per conversation.
- **Improvement roadmap**: Data-driven prioritisation of model or prompt changes.

**Talking point**: “AI & Intents show whether our automation is helping or hurting, and where to improve.”

---

## 15. Wrap-up Reports

**What it is**
Reports built from resolution wrap-up data (e.g. category, outcome, notes) — configurable per team; aggregate and filter by period, team, outcome.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Why conversations end**: Categories and outcomes (e.g. “Resolved”, “Referred”) show what agents are achieving.
- **Quality and training**: Patterns in notes and outcomes highlight recurring issues or best practices.
- **Compliance**: Structured wrap-up supports “how did we resolve this?” for audits.
- **Product feedback**: Outcomes and notes can feed into product or process improvements.

**Talking point**: “Wrap-up Reports turn resolve data into insights on outcomes and quality.”

---

## 16. CSAT

**What it is**
Customer satisfaction after chat resolution: score distribution, recent feedback, trends over time; optional breakdown by journey or segment.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Voice of the taxpayer**: Direct feedback on support quality, not just volume or speed.
- **Trends**: See if satisfaction improves with training, process, or product changes.
- **Targets**: Set and track CSAT goals (e.g. “> 4.0 average” or “> 80% positive”).
- **Recognition**: Link high CSAT to agents or teams for recognition and best-practice sharing.

**Talking point**: “CSAT tells us whether taxpayers are leaving satisfied, not just whether we closed the chat.”

---

## 17. Live Events

**What it is**
Real-time or near-real-time stream of events (e.g. page views, messages, conversions) for monitoring and debugging.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Operational awareness**: See that events are flowing (e.g. after a release or integration change).
- **Quick diagnosis**: When something breaks, live events help verify “is the SDK/API sending?” and “what’s coming in?”.
- **Demos**: Show stakeholders live activity for trust and training.

**Talking point**: “Live Events give immediate visibility that the system is working and data is flowing.”

---

## 18. Reliability & Scale

**What it is**
Cloud-native architecture designed to handle peak loads (e.g., tax deadlines) without downtime.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Uptime Assurance**: System stays responsive even during massive traffic spikes (e.g. filing deadlines).
- **Data Integrity**: No message is lost; every interaction is queued and processed safely.
- **Proven Scale**: Tested to handle thousands of concurrent users and messages per second.

**Talking point**: "Built to handle the busiest tax days without missing a beat."

---

## 19. Security, Trust & Compliance

**What it is**
Enterprise-grade security controls including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), granular Audit Logs, Data Encryption, and Session Management.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Control**: Strict permissions ensure staff only see what they need (e.g. Agent vs Supervisor vs Admin).
- **Accountability**: Audit Logs trace every sensitive action (login, data access, settings change) for investigations.
- **Data Privacy**: Taxpayer data is protected according to policy, with encryption and access controls.

**Talking point**: “We provide the control and accountability needed for government-grade data handling.”

---

## 20. Settings

**What it is**
Configuration hub for integrations, user management, and system behavior.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Integrations**: Securely connect to CRM and other apps using API Keys.
- **User Management**: Invite and manage access; align with HR onboarding/offboarding.
- **Customisation**: Tailor navigation labels and system messages to fit the organisation's terminology.
- **Session Policy**: Configure timeout and security policies to match organisational standards.

**Talking point**: “Settings are where we configure the platform to fit your specific environment.”

---

## 21. Docs

**What it is**
In-app documentation: quickstart, API, SDK, WhatsApp integration, AI tracking, etc.

**How it helps the organisation**

- **Onboarding**: New teams and developers get going without hunting for internal wikis.
- **Consistency**: One place for “how we send events” and “how we integrate” reduces mistakes and support load.
- **Adoption**: Easier integration and tracking mean more data and better analytics across the organisation.

**Talking point**: “Docs make it easy for our teams and partners to use the platform correctly.”

---
